def bc_index(kb):
    """Build and maintain an index used by the backward chaining algorithm.

    Backward chaining starts from a goal and asks:
        "Which rules have this goal as their conclusion?"

    For example, if the KB contains:

        A & B ==> C
        D ==> C

    the index stores:

        rules[C] = [[A, B], [D]]

    This allows pl_bc_entails() to immediately find the rules that could
    prove C, instead of scanning every clause in the KB each time.

    The function returns three data structures:

    facts
        A set containing propositions that are explicitly known to be true
        in the KB, such as the given Sudoku cells.

    rules
        A dictionary mapping each possible conclusion to the premises of
        rules that can derive it.

    proven
        A set containing propositions that backward chaining has already
        successfully derived. These results are kept so later queries can
        reuse previous work instead of proving the same propositions again.

    The index is stored inside the KB as '_bc_index'. This means repeated
    calls to pl_bc_entails() on the same KB can reuse the existing index.

    'seen' records how many KB clauses have already been indexed. If new
    facts are added to the KB while solving the Sudoku, only those new
    clauses need to be processed rather than rebuilding the whole index.

    The core logic of the backward chaining algorithm is based on the algorithm from the
    lecture notes (Propositional Logic Slide 98):
        1. Check whether the current goal is already a known fact.
        2. Find rules whose conclusion matches the current goal.
        3. For each matching rule, recursively prove every premise.
        4. If all premises of any matching rule can be proved, return True.
        5. Otherwise, return False.

    However, the implementation also includes several improvements:
    1. Indexing of the KB to allow for efficient retrieval of rules based on their conclusions
       (implemented in a separate function bc_index).
    2. Caching of proven goals to avoid redundant computations.
    3. Loop detection to prevent infinite recursion in case of circular dependencies.
    4. Prioritisation of rules whose premises contain more known facts or previously proven
       goals. These rules are more likely to succeed without requiring further recursion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kb : PropDefiniteKB
